            <p>Horizon Zero Dawn is a captivating story of love, fatherhood, loss, confusion, acceptance, and finding out who you are and what your place in the world is. Aloy is a young woman who has grown up with one person who truly loved her – Rost. He seemingly lost his own daughter, took her in after being shunned as an outcast by his tribe, and raised her as his own from the time she was a baby. We see their bond grow as time goes on and finally play as her when she’s a little kid.</p>
        
            <p>This is Guerrilla Games’ best effort, one of the PS4’s greatest games, and the best game ever crafted from the ground up for the platform. It combines a gripping narrative with intense action that blends both fast-paced combat with slower-paced, tense stealth sections perfectly. Everything about their vision for this game clicks into place and is accentuated by a stellar presentation. The game features top-shelf graphical work, a unique and enjoyable soundtrack, alongside a fantastic cast to make an unforgettable experience.</p>
        
            <p>Overall, Guerrilla games' title Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game and well worth the money. 9/10.</p>
